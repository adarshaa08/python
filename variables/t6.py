#Constants
#Python doesn't have built-in support for constants, but by convention, variables that are meant to be constants are written in all uppercase letters.
PI = 3.14
GRAVITY = 9.8
#Deleting Variables
#You can delete variables using the del statement.
x = 5
del x  # x is now deleted
#Unpacking
#Python allows the unpacking of a collection (like a list or tuple) into variables.
x, y, z = [1, 2, 3]
#Type Conversion
#You can convert between different data types by using type conversion functions like int(), float(), str(), etc.
x = "123"
y = int(x)  # y is now an integer 123
