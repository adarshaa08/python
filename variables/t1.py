#Variable Declaration and Assignment
#In Python, variables are created when you first assign a value to them. You don't need to declare a variable's type, as Python is dynamically typed. This means the Python interpreter infers the type of a variable at runtime.
x = 5        # x is now an integer
y = "Hello"  # y is now a string
