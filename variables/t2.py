2. Variable Names
Rules for Naming: Variable names in Python can contain letters (a-z, A-Z), digits (0-9), and underscores (_). However, they cannot start with a digit.
Case Sensitivity: Variable names are case-sensitive. For example, myVar, MyVar, and myvar are three different variables.
Conventions: By convention, variable names should be lowercase with words separated by underscores (snake_case) for readability. For instance, my_variable.
